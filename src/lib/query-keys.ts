// Central TanStack Query key factory — the single place that defines how

// app must build its key from here so invalidation always hits the right
// entries (e.g. mutating a session invalidates exactly the session keys).
//
// Key layout: ["sessions", ...] groups everything session-scoped so a
// connection switch can drop the whole subtree with one prefix invalidate;
// global catalog/project keys stand alone.
